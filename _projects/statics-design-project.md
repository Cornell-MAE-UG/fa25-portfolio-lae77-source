For the class Statics and Mechanics of Solids, I was tasked with designing a 2D mechanism made from 3 pins, 1 rigid bar, and a linear actuator. The design space was 150cm x 50cm. 

To complete this design, I chose the high force rod style actuator. This actuator had the highest max force and one of the longest stroke lengths to ensure highest max load possible raised to the highest height possible. I chose a long rigid bar (almost as long as the design space) to obtain max load as well. This longer bar will give the largest angle possible so the y-component of the actuator can be the largest to lift the biggest load as seen in the image.
