My name is Londyn Elmer, and I am a biomedical engineering student driven by a deep love for service and a desire to improve people’s quality of life. I’m especially passionate about genetics, which is why I hope to concentrate in molecular, cellular, and systems engineering—to better understand the biological foundations of health and develop impactful solutions. Creative expression is also a vital part of who I am; it has shaped the way I think about engineering, helping me approach challenges with imagination, empathy, and a broader perspective.
